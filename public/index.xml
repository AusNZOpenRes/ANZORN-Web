      <description>Summary The Melbourne Open Research Network (MORN) seeks to promote open practices, and as part of this vision is committed to the provision of a safe, inclusive, welcoming and harassment-free atmosphere to all. All parties to activities associated with the Network are required to be compliant with the code of conduct. If you observe something that you do not feel is consistent with these principles, please report them to the steering committee.</description>

      <title>Making your open research community</title>

      <description>The object of this network is the propagation of open research practices through local activities. Effectively, an open research community is like a nucleation site around which the snowflake (or pearl, whatever analogy you prefer) of open research develops. This network is like a snow machine (I&amp;rsquo;ve gone mad on analogies but stay with me), optimising the conditions for open practices to develop in your local area.
To that end, this post intends to lay out how you can promote open research in your place of work and it borrows liberally from Loek Brinkman and Anita Eerland&amp;rsquo;s guide to forming the original Open science Community Utrecht.</description>
