title   : What is the Open Research Network
description: >
  The Australia and New Zealand Open Research Network is a collection of researchers and research-associated workers. In practice, ANZORN is a network of local networks distributed without Australia and New Zealand. It aims to facilitate the growth of Open practices by bringing together independently motivated and like-minded people, and providing a platform for the sharing of resources.
